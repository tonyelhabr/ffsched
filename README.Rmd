This repo stores some ad-hoc analysis and visualizations of personal fantasy football (FF) data.
Right now, it's only for a public league on ESPN.

## Getting Started

To repeat the same analysis for your own ESPN FF league, you'll need to manually download your league's team and box score information (in JSON format) using the following URL templates (where the curly braces "{}" indicate values to substitute):

+ scores: http://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{season}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueid}?view=mMatchup&view=mMatchupScore&scoringPeriodId={scoreingPeriodId}

  + For 2018, I used  the URL http://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/2018/segments/0/leagues/453218?view=mMatchup&view=mMatchupScore&scoringPeriodId=20 to download all of my league's data.
  
  + For 2019, when I started to play in a dynasty league, I used the URL http://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/2019/segments/0/leagues/899513?view=mMatchup&view=mMatchupScore&scoringPeriodId=20.
  
+ teams: http://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/{season}/segments/0/leagues/{leagueId}?scoringPeriodId={scoringPeriodId}&view=mRoster&view=mTeam

If you're going to be downloading data from a completed season, then I would recommend setting the `scoringPeriodId` to a number larger than the last week of the season (including playoffs). I believe that the data returned is the same for any number greater than the number corresponding to the last week of your FF season (so something like `20` should always work).

For whatever reason, I have not been successful in my attempts to send an HTTP request to return the same data (even though the league is "public"). This is why the data needs to be downloaded manually. (If you figure out how to download the data via a request, then please send a pull request.)

The teams data can also be retrieved from the scores JSON without making any modifications to the code originally written specifically to extract teams, so retrieving the JSON file corresponding to the teams URL above is not completely necessary.

The link for the scores data can also be found in the Network tab when browser inspecting on the Standing page of your league. For example, the correct link would look something like https://fantasy.espn.com/apis/v3/games/ffl/seasons/2019/segments/0/leagues/899513?scoringPeriodId=13&view=mMatchup&view=mMatchupScore&view=mRoster&view=mScoreboard&view=mSettings&view=mStatus&view=mTeam&view=modular&view=mNav.

## Highlights

Below are some hastily-made visualizations for the "Texas Fantasy Football" league on ESPN. (Yes, it's a super creative name, I know.)
