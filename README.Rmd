`{ffsched}` can generate unique sports league schedules. If you happen to have an ESPN fantasy football league, then `{ffsched}` can pull your league's scores and help you figure out the likelihood of your standings by combining teams' actual scores with simulated schedules. (Often the team that scores the most points across all games in the season does not end up winning due to "unlucky" opponent matchups!)

## Installation

You can install the development version of `{ffsched}` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tonyelhabr/ffsched")
```

## Basic Usage

See the vignette.
